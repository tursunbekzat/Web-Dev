Mom (Olga Ivanovna) and Dad (Victor Ivanovich)!

This magical day is very close,
this unique and unforgettable holiday...
The Holiday of True Love - our Wedding!
The way to the birthday of our family was easy
and joyful, and in this we have your merit.
You have taught us a lot, and we will try to always
to remember that there is nothing more important than love,
understanding and respect for one another!
You are the main guests at this celebration!
Without you there would not be this day!
